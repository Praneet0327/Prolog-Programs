## Introduction
This repository contains a series of Prolog programs that cover a range of essential topics in logical programming and problem-solving. These programs serve as a practical guide for students, researchers, and anyone interested in learning how to solve problems using Prolog.

## Programs

### Factorial Calculation
- **Factorial of a Given Number**

A simple Prolog program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursive definitions.

### 4-Queen Problem
- **Solving the N-Queen Problem**

A Prolog program to solve the classic N-Queen problem, demonstrating how to place four queens on a NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

### Depth First Search
- **Solving Real-life Problems using Depth First Search**

Implement a program to solve real-life problems using depth first search (DFS) algorithm in Prolog.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Solving the Tic-Tac-Toe Problem**

A Prolog program to play and solve the Tic-Tac-Toe game, ensuring the best possible moves are made.

### Water Jug Problem
- **Solving the Water Jug Problem**

A Prolog program to solve the water jug problem, demonstrating how to measure out an exact amount of water using two jugs of different capacities.

### 8 Puzzle Problem
- **Solving the 8 Puzzle Problem**

Implement a program to solve the 8 puzzle problem, showcasing the ability to rearrange the tiles to achieve the goal state.

### Tower of Hanoi
- **Solving the Tower of Hanoi Problem**

A classic Prolog program to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem, moving disks from one peg to another while following the rules of the game.

### Medical Diagnosis
- **Medical Diagnosis using Prolog**

A Prolog program for medical diagnosis, demonstrating the application of logical rules and knowledge bases to diagnose medical conditions.

## Getting Started
To get started with these Prolog programs, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate through the individual program files.

## Prerequisites
- SWI-Prolog or any Prolog interpreter

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Prolog-Programs.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the program directory:
    ```bash
    cd Prolog-Programs
    ```
3. Open and run the desired Prolog program file using your Prolog interpreter:
    ```prolog
    swipl -s monkey_banana.pl
    ```
